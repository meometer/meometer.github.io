Every story, every group, _every subject has its own vocabulary_.

Meometer is no exception.

When we talk about _Projects_, here's what we mean.

<br />

## What is a "Project"?

A _Project_ is any collection of [_Actions_][about-actions], meaning _it's something which takes multiple steps_.

_Projects_ can last anywhere from a few days (like painting a bedroom) to a lifetime (like cat juggling).

> It takes a lifetime to master cat juggling.

There's no need to distinguish in meometer: a _Project_ is a _Project_ is a _Project_.

## Keeping it Clean

To keep them organized you _favorite_ and _archive_.

> Favorite and archive projects.

<br />

To _personalize_, you add details.

![image: screencap - Crazy llama.][image-007]

> Add pets.
