Every story, every group, _every subject has its own vocabulary_.

meometer is no exception.

When we talk about _Actions_, here's what we mean.

## What is an "Action"?

You did it. Whatever *it* was, whether ice dancing or writing an email or unload the dishwasher or fight invaders from another dimension.

That's an _Action_: it's done and in the past.

They graduate from [_Intents_][about-intents], in meometer's parlance.

> **an Intent becomes an Action when you complete it**.

## Examples

Let's get our heads wrapped around this with some examples.

<br />

<br />

### Intent + Effort = Action

Your _Actions_ define who you as a human. Unacted upon _Intent_ is where regret grows.

### Unplanned Actions

Sometimes the [Kosmos][kosmos] has other plans for you. A butterfly flaps its wings in [Funkytown][funkytown] and, voila!, your kitchen pipe explodes.

Examples of suprise _Actions_:

- [ ] Paul dropped by. Play guitar with Paul.
- [ ] Xxxxx
- [ ] Clean because the cat vomited up a stegasarus amount of grass.

Sometimes you forget to include an _Action_ in your project and want to include a record because its important.

- [ ] check licensing on imagery
- [ ] write a unit test
- [ ] remove the fox from under the house

[ @geoffrey - show how to add unplanned _Actions_ ]

### Actions and Projects

You can assign _Actions_ to multiple [_Projects_][about-projects] allowing you to see how much attention you place on different aspects of your life.

### Actions and Scores

You can also score customized aspects of _Actions_. For example,

- enjoyment
- badassednessatude
- difficulty
