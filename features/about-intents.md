Every story, every group, _every subject has its own vocabulary_.

meometer is no exception.

When we talk about _Intents_, here's what we mean.

## What is an "Intent"?

You _will_ do it. Whatever *it* is, whether planting flowers or chainsaw sculpting a bear or driving to work. 

That's an _Intent_: it is in the future.

They graduate into [_Actions_][about-actions] when you complete them.

> Power yourself up by turning your _Intents_ into _Actions_.

## Examples

Let's get our heads wrapped around this with some examples.

### Intents

They can be fun or lame, fast or slow, and a classic way to approach what to say here is with a _Verb_ _Noun_ strategy.

I will _do the thing_ (verb) to _the thing_ (noun).

Fun _Intents_:
- play guitar
- brush the cat
- play Boggle with Enrique and Lupe

Common _Intents_:
- cook breakfast
- draft email to Florence re: shipping costs
- fold laundry

Lame _Intents_ which still need to get done:
- commute to work
- mow the back yard
- get the AMC Pacer an oil change

Big _Intents_:
- design and document a new feature
- campaign for State Senate
- defeat enemies (note: make enemies first)

Little _Intents_:
- remind Mom & Dad I'm grateful
- do 5 pushups
- eat a snack

### Don't Worry About...

**...accuracy:** clean up mistakes during the 
_Lap Review_ or even later if need be.

**...xxxxx:** xxxxx

**...xxxxx:** xxxxx

The goal is fast, fast, fast because you need to get busy!
