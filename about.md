## It's All About Me.

Well, **the _you_ version of _me_**.

meometer — like a _speedometer_ — measures something. It measures you.

Why on earth would you want to do this?

Because its a fast, efficient way to become the baddest version of yourself possible. You know, the rich, healthy, well balanced version of yourself.

meometer helps turn _you_ into <blink>Y O U</blink>.

<br/>

### How?

You define things in your life you want to track, and watch your [_Intent_][about-intents] become reality through [_Action_][about-actions].

**![gif: A couple of _Projects_, _Intents_, _Actions_.][image-001]**

As a reminder time exists and is a precious, limited resource, in the desktop application _The Line_ drops from the top of your screen over a chunk of time.

**![gif: _The Line_ super zoomed in or fullscreen in a few seconds][image-002]**

These chunks of time are punctuated by [_Nudges_][about-nudges], **messages from you -> to you**, reminders to get the most out of your time and effort and _life_.

**![gif: a few _Nudges_][image-003]**

<br/>

### Visualize Where Your Attention Goes

Yep. It's scary, though by tracking [_Actions_][about-actions] and [_Projects_][about-projects] we get to see everything from [_opportunity loss_][opportunity-loss] to the brilliant, sublime uses of our time.

Sculpting, playing, windsurfing, dinner with friends, etc. 

<br/>

### Keep Yourself on the Rails

Correct your behavior in the moment.

> Don't find out too late you forgot to be awesome!*

Be your best self.

## version 2

This, the second generation of meometer, **builds on the tens of thousands of hours of experience learned from using version 1 continuously for the last 7 years**.

Evolving from a [pomodoro tool][pomodoro-tool] to a _self mentorship platform_, v2 opens the gates to your evolution.

We're talking **new benefits** from the **new features** and **new flexibility**.

Thanks for trying, and we love feedback!
