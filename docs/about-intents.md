Every story, every group, _every subject has its own vocabulary_.

Meometer is no exception.

## What is an "Intent"?

You _will_ do it. Whatever *it* is, whether planting flowers or chainsaw sculpting a bear or driving to work. 

That's an _Intent_: it is in the future.

They graduate into [_Actions_][about-actions] when you complete them.

Think _Verb_ _Noun_ like these:
