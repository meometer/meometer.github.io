Every story, every group, _every subject has its own vocabulary_.

Meometer is no exception.

When we talk about _Nudges_, here's what we mean.

<br />

## What is a "Nudge"?

A _Nudge_ is a message during a planned pause in your workflow to help maximize your productivity.

Uhhhhh. What now? What does that mean?

It's like a self-prescribed personalize motivational poster when you need a little prod to stay on track/get off Fbook/buckle down/xxxxx/xxxxx...
