I concluded my mind is my enemy, and, because of the bias generated in my grey matter, your mind is your enemy.

I know this sounds harsh, so let me clarify.

I don't mean it's out to kill you, **I mean it's out to trick you at every turn**, and because of our minds' stealth, we miss the machinations.

Don't believe me?

Let's walk through a little thing called **cognitive bias**.

## Cognitive Bias
The super duper offical definition:

> ""
> - source

Translation: _Your mind is your enemy_.

Dozens. Hundreds. Thousands. More? of these little bastards live in our minds.

Squatters who lie to us!

Like bloatware on a 2006 HP Laptop or bloatware on a 2017 HP Laptop, they come preinstalled whether we want 'em or not.

And we don't.

Each bias is like a scared, crotchety, old switchboard operator with an agenda: they have a belief and want to promote it to us like an aggressive missionary.

Biases work like this:
- they deliberately disguise information ([example 01](), [example 02](), [example 03](), et. al.)
- they deliberately over-emphasize info aligning with it's belief (hyperawareness, rationalization, people exploit this intentionally)
- and they fight like Terminators until dead

We don't want our minds full of uninvited liars.

Fewer biases means a more accurate view of everything. We become better

## "I'm a Good Driver."
As meometer marches to profitability I work reception at a [drive school](https://learntodrivecolorado.com) in the Front Range. (When it's quiet I automate every last task I can with Python which is ludicrously fun.)

People come in to take permit tests and drive tests.

When explaining what they need 3 out of 5 adults — not quite Trident gum numbers — say the exact same phrase.

                        GEOFFREY THE RECEPTIONIST
        Good afternoon. How can I help you?

                        ADULT CUSTOMER
        So I need to take a driver's test
        because...{reason number 9}

                        GEOFFREY THE RECEPTIONIST
        Great. May I see your permi—

                        ADULT CUSTOMER
        I'm a good driver.

                        GEOFFREY THE RECEPTIONIST
        Brilliant. No need to test you then because
        you know every last thing about automobiles,
        automobile maintenance, traffic patterns,
        handling in adverse weather conditions, and
        have all 498 Colorado traffic statutes
        memorized, correct?

(I never say that last bit.)

So, do I trust they're a good driver? Of course not, because their opinion is driven by their mind.

Their lying, duplicitous mind. The biases exhibited:

I trust the Examiners with their external observations. (And their education.)

[ THIS IS THE THESIS: ]

It's hard to get outside of one's own way to get a critical view of actions in general let alone something so habituated as _driving_.

After more than 30 years of locked in habits (in my case), how the hell would I know if I'm a good driver? And what if my first and only instructor was completely bananas?

                        TERRIBLE INSTRUCTOR
        You should try to jump your van on the
        railroad tracks over by the prison. It's
        even better on a motorcycle without a helmet.

Biases behave like organisms, defending themselves to the point of ignoring reality.

This happened in front of me three weeks ago:

                        EXAMINER
        You failed your test because you didn't
        stop at the stop sign at 14th and Ford.

                        DRIVER
        I didn't see a stop sign!

                        EXAMINER
        Exactly.

                        DRIVER
        You're wrong. There was no stop sign!

                        EXAMINER
        I've driven this route 173 times.

                        DRIVER
        But, there's no stop sign!

                        EXAMINER
        I designed the route. It's my favorite, ever, in 31 years of doing this.

                        DRIVER
        This is bullshit! I'm a great driver!

Guess how many people have said, "I'm not a very good driver."

Exactly zero.

100% of people surveyed — or not surveyed because I have _never_ asked — believe they're a good driver.

Why?

Because they listen to the whispers of their enemy.

Here's the mathematical formula for their belief: _I am a good driver_.

I don't know who Csaba Cere is.
I have never been to a car race.
I do not change my own oil.
I have never checked the pressure on my tires and have no idea what they're at right now.
I do not watch any F1, Kart, Rally, Motorcycle, or Nascar races.
I have never had a subscription to Car & Driver or Road and Track.
I don't know there's a channel on my tv called Speed.
I do not know how many traffic laws exist.
I have no idea how much torque is put to my back wheels.
(Also, what's torque, and why would I, a driver, care?)
I have never driven a right handed car.
Nor have I driven in a foreign land.

Therefore (or a formula in LaTeX)

What these folks really mean is: "I can adequately operate a handful of cars." (No standards, no right-hand drives, nothing rear wheel drive and turbo, no busses, no semis, no motorcycles...)

## "You monster."
Every once in a while I make a startling claim and watch the horror in a Customer's eyes.

A debate starts between Customer and Examiner where the professionally trained, educated expert tries to explain a concept only to have the ignorant (proper definition) Customer attempt to correct the expert who is inarguably right.

When the Customer needs backup for their completely wrong assumption they turn to me, the receptionist.

I say, "I'm the worst driver in here," and watch their circuits fuse because this is the first time they have **ever** heard this sentence. It does not compute.

After the Customer's head angle straightens out, I follow up with, "When it comes to drive testing I trust the professionally trained expert's opinion and knowledge on what the State says is the right way to do things." 

Sometimes my comments recalibrate their minds and helps them recognize they don't even know the criteria they're getting tested on, let alone the DMV's position on what's correct.

## False Positives

Our biases, like 5 person sub-reddits, latch onto anything and everything which backs their beliefs while ignoring and dispelling anything which disproves.

One of these methods for distorting truth is the _false positive_, taking credit for something unrelated.

Do something wrong or do something unrelated, see a good result an intentionally [mis-correlate/causate]

This happens in any domain: poker, investing, relationships, life...

If your internal dialogue starts with, "I finally got this figured out!", I'll bet you're guided by a bias. (And about to learn a life lesson.)

## "That's Big."

![image: Steve Martin and Audrey II]()

We only talked about a handful of types. Here's a list of known, defined biases. Here's another.

Look at it!

> That's big.

These things pop up like exoplanets both in definition and in our minds.

## Exploitability

With multiple ways to stroke each bias — keywords, arguments, emotional ploys, and more — organizations and individuals use _Behavioral Science_ to drive your behavior.

Around formally since _rhetoric_ in ancient Greece, nowadays _Behavioral Science_ is supercharged with AI and infinite flops and [psychographic maps]() and better-than-free, ubiquitous delivery directly to our faces.

## D:fence:

One defense against this, against getting hijacked, is having fewer and weaker biases.

I use meometer to 1) study them via _Nudges_ and 2) catalog them in the real world via a _Project_ called _biascatcher_.

These practices help distance myself, allowing for clearer thinking and a chance to dispel them in myself.

P.S. I'm a good driver.
