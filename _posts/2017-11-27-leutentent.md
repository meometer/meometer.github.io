For the last 3 months I lived without internet like a feral beast.

I got wired over the weekend, fencing in my corner of the West.

Will this be the last time I'm ever not wired?

<br/>

___

<br/>

## Dances With HTTP

Leutenent Dunbar, in [Dances With Wolves][imdb-dances-with-wolves], requests an assignment out West to experience the dying phenomenon of wilderness.

In the same way, I don't carry a phone so I can experience the dying phenomenon of human wilderness.

![Dances With Wolves][image-dances-with-wolves]

This decade hit an inflection point because to the best of my knowledge I am the only remaining human over 12 years old without a phone.

Sometime around puberty every young _homo sapien sapien_ gets handed a phone by their parents and they evolve into _homo sapien wired_.

<br/>

___

<br/>

## No Phones

![Edna][image-edna-no-capes]

Save for two phones purchased for development, I lived without mobiles my entire life.

On purpose.

Don't misunderstand me, they're amazing! A supercomputer in my pocket with permanent access to all humanity's collective knowledge?! (And disfunction.)

They're not for me because far too easily they knock me off balance.

<br/>

___

<br/>

## Balance

If, like me, you fall under the moniker _homo sapien sapien_ (or _homo sapien wired_) sometimes balance can be tough.

I get out of balance even now at my geologic age when I should be as wise and steady as a Galapagos tortoise.

A simple recipe for disaster which I can whip up on a moments notice consists of: 1) infinite curiousity (ding!), 2) infinite access to infinite information (oh, shiny, shiny internet!), and 3) non-infinite self awareness and self control (guilty!).

With a phone, I live permanently inside that disaster.

Even now, just getting back online after a long break, I fiercely have to keep myself in check.

<br/>

___

<br/>

My social media diet consists only of twitter. Makes sense, it owns the tightest constraints: _get your idea across in 140/280 chars_.

Beyond how it makes people get to the point, I like how well I can track specific subjects I enjoy like  _technology_, _art_, _astronomy_, and, ugh, _politics_.

Politics. My lifelong fascination with this bloody nonsense exists due to my curiousity around how our species works for and against itself.

<br/>

___

<br/>

Over the weekend, my first wired weekend in forever, I checked twitter.

A bunch.

A handful of political dramas on which I keep my eye grew and shifted and escalated.

Every 110 minutes, _Anything new?_

<br/>

___

<br/>

I already track potentially wasted time with a _Project_ in meometer called `negative` (aka Negative Habits) and, in this case, an _Intent_ labeled `browse twitter politics`.

By defining this _Intent_ I was/am conciously forced to decide: Is this — `browsing twitter politics`, something which lives light-years beyond my [sphere of influence][sphere-of-influence] — a good use of my time?

Sometimes it is. Sometimes it is the optimal use of my time.

I read something which dispels a growing story in my mind, or a joke which releases some anger.

Sometimes I stumble across an answer to a coding issue I have and shave 30 hours of frustration off my life.

<br/>

___

<br/>

> There is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and never return.
> <br />&#8208; Marcus Aurelius

<br/>

___

<br/>

These twitter checks happened between studying technology, code commits, prose commits, playing guitar, and playing with the critter.

Which _Actions_, do you think, make me more proud: 1) Screwing off on twitter to scratch some knuckleheaded itch or 2) the moments when I grew and created and played?

My twitter checks have grown both less frequent and shorter because I started tracking in meometer.

<br/>

___

<br/>

## Paradox or Irony?

Funny thing about my little human wilderness idear: I need fences, and I know I do.

I need a reminder life is finite, that I live in a _timebox_ called a lifetime, that I can never get a day back.

I need a constant reminder because I can so easily get lost in time.

I need _The Line_.

<br/>

___

<br/>

> Oh, yeah, good news! _The Line_ is back.

<br/>

___
