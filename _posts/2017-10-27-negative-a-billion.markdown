You know those emails you get which ask only one thing: "On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend _whatever_..."

Answers to this question produce a metric called a [Net Promoter Score](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/), a measure of the likelihood a User will talk about your amazing product. It’s incredibly useful, higher is better and you can get negative scores.

Anyway, on a scale of 1 to 10, I gave our v2-beta-1 a score of ***negative it sucks so bad it's not even a number*** which then threw off our cumulative NPS score for the month.

> (Personally, I was hoping for a 4.)

**Totally my fault, of course!** Augh.

So, what'd we learn with this painful first release?


### 1) Show Stopping UX Issues
A trifecta of pain-in-the-butt-to-use issues top the list on the _Let's Take Another Run At This Before Releasing Into More Hands_ board.

***Learnings:***
- Let the sauce simmer some more. It ain't ready yet.


### 2) Show Stopping Bugs
Documented and prioritized. Nothing's a killer with biggest challenge already fixed.

***Learnings:***
- Up our testing game.


### 3) Design Dissonance

Sitting with meometer v2-beta-1, using it, always finding my head a little sideways when I did, I realized v2's current UI lives about 179.97 degrees from where we're heading.

Dictated by both the death of v1's technology and our new tech stack for v2, the path from _now_ to _release_ to _v3_ winds more than Joyce's Ulysses.

![Dublin or whatever.](https://iibawards-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/projects/images/000/000/193/large.jpg)

This galactic dissonance inspired meometer's _The Design Manifesto_ to encapsulate _what_ and _why_. This way, when we're limited by time/talent/resources we're still aimed in the right direction.

***Learnings:***
- Result: meometer's _The Design Manifesto_.
- Result: The new _Lap Review_ design which centered around a value from the manifesto, _Slap Jack Fast&#8482;_.

## Back to Work

v2-beta-2 reverts back — I'm using it already — to a desktop application, and still needs attention.

And some general grooming of our website and such.

So back to work for me, and #doNotCarriacou*.

Cheers,<br />
