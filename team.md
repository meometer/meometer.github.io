Pushing this project along we not only have known each other a decade but also co-founded another project together. While that one didn't pan out, we got to see first hand how the other handles adversity.

(Turns out we get all [Shackleton-like][shackleton-official].)

![Mettle tests well.][endeavor-001]

More than balance each other, we *amplify* each others' strengths and tame each others' weaknesses.

While we bootstrap to profitability, Geoffrey tackles the technical stuff and Brad manages everything from Operations to Intellectual Property to copyediting.

Makes sense because Geoffrey grew up in a wildly technical household and Brad's got 2 co-founder-to-exits under his belt to go along with his 35+ patents.

Both are even second generation entrepreneurs.

We're looking for [investors who meet these criteria][investors].

## Long Term

This, the second generation of meometer, **builds on the tens of thousands of hours of experience using version 1 continuously for the last 7 years**.

We've waited for a confluence of tech to catch up to an idea, and, while waiting, studied — everything from _emerging technologies_ to _lean startup methodologies_ — and marinated ourselves in the prolific Front Range entrepreneurial community.

We're excited to see where the next 7 years takes us.

We have more than a few ideas on where they will.

The day we hit profitability, we're on board.
