## Leadership

Pushing this project along, Geoffrey and Brad not only have known each other a decade but also co-founded another project together. While that one didn't pan out, they got to see first hand how the other handles adversity.

(Turns out they get all [Xxxxx Emerson-like](link missing).)

The Endeavor

More than balance each other, they *amplify* each others' strengths and tame each others' weaknesses.

While we bootstrap to profitability, Geoffrey tackles the technical stuff while Brad manages everything from Operations to Intellectual Property to copyediting.

Makes sense because Geoffrey grew up in a wildly technical household and Brad's got 2 co-founder-to-exits under his belt to go along with his 35+ patents.

Both are even second generation entrepreneurs.

We're looking for [investors who meet these criteria][investors].

## Long Term

This, the second generation of meometer, builds on the tens of thousands of hours of experience using version 1 continuously for the last 7 years.

And that's just the software side of things.

Confluence of technologies Geoffrey's waited for almost a decade.


 but also the education from and exposure to the prolific Front Range entrepreneurial community.

We're excited to see where the next 7 years takes us.

We've got a few ideas on that.
