## Like James Cann in Thief

Caan explains in the commentary in Michael Mann's [Thief][film-thief]:

> My character does not use contractions when he speaks because **he does not want to waste time** with misunderstandings.

## What You Will Get Out of Team meometer

### Commitment

Geoffrey's been at project meometer for about a decade with tendrils extending back even further into the depths of time.

{{ Brad's a triathlete with wins of the co-founding-to-exit flavor to the tune of $100M. }}

Not only have Brad and Geoffrey both been friends for a decade but also co-founded another project together. While that one didn't pan out, they got to see first hand how the other handles adversity.

(Turns out they get all [Shackleton-like][shackleton-official].)



<br/>

### Leadership Stability and Experience

xxxxx


<br/>

### Transparency

With meometer itself intended to **amplify self awareness** and a seasoned team, expect straight-forward conversations and {{ xxxxx }}.


<br/>

### Humor

These always make us laugh:

| team member | film                | tv            | comedian              |
| ----------- | :----:              | :--:          | :---------:           |
| Brad        | [_Animal House_][imdb-animal-house]      | {{ ? }}       | {{ ? }                |
| Geoffrey    | [_Blazing Saddles_][imdb-blazing-saddles]   | [_South Park_][south-park]  | [Doug Stanhope][stanhope-yelp] |


<br/>

### Users

Geoffrey has over 25,000 hours using v1. {{ Brad found a way to implement mini-good habits. }}



<br/>

### A Long-Term Vision Which Betters Humanity

We're excited to see what happens to humanity when we have 25M Users.

(We're also exited to see what happens to shareholders.)





<br/>

### Teachability

That's the whole point of the product, for goodnesssake!
