## Like James Cann in Thief

Caan explains in the commentary in Michael Mann's [Thief][film-thief]:

> My character does not use contractions when he speaks because **he does not want to waste time** with misunderstandings.

## What You Will Get Out of Team meometer

### Commitment

Geoffrey's been at project meometer for about a decade with tendrils extending back even further into the depths of time.

{Brad's a triathlete with wins of the co-founding to exit flavor to the tune of $100M.}

Not only have Brad and Geoffrey both been friends for a decade but also co-founded another project together. While that one didn't pan out, they got to see first hand how the other handles adversity.

(Turns out they get all [Xxxxx Emerson-like](link missing).)



<br/>

### Leadership Stability and Experience

xxxxx


<br/>

### Transparency

With meometer itself intended to _amplify self awareness_ and a seasoned team, expect straight-forward conversations and {xxxxx}.


<br/>

### Humor

These always make us laugh:

| team member | film                | tv            | comedian              |
+ ----------- + ----                + --            + ---------             |
| Brad        | _Animal House_      | {?}           | { ? }                 |
| Geoffrey    | _Blazing Saddles_   | _South Park_  | [Doug Stanhope](yelp) |


<br/>

### Users

Geoffrey has over 25,000 hours using v1. {Brad~}



<br/>

### A Long-Term Vision Which Betters Humanity

We're excited to see what happens to humanity when we have 25M Users.

(We're also exited to see what happens to shareholders.)





<br/>

### Teachability

That's the whole point of the product, for goodnesssake!
